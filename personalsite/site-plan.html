We offer programming competencies every week, on Saturdays, at 6 pm Mountain Standard Time. Also, we offer video games competencies every week, on Fridays, at 5 pm Mountain Standard Time.
Which ages can participate?: 
The age range is from 7 years old to 17 years old.
Inscribe: 
Competencies are every week. If you like to inscribe to any competency, you have to fill out a form, by clicking on this button. You have to type your first name, last name, birth date, the day that you want to enroll, and if you want to inscribe to programming competency or videogames competency. Clicking this other button, you have the information about each competency, either programming competency or videogames competency, and the programming language that you need to practice and learn, or the videogame that you have to practice at home, alone, or with friends.

      <h3>Competencies</h3>
      <p>
        Programming competencies: 
The children need to learn about Python, C++, C#, PHP, JavaScript, Java, and other programming languages. April 15th, Saturday, at 6 pm, will be the next programming competence. The programming language that we will code that day will be Python. On the Internet, there are a lot of pages to learn to code in Python, C++, C#, PHP, JavaScript, Java, and all of the existing programming languages. Some of those sites are www.w3schools.com, stackoverflow.com, and others. Also, you can learn to code by watching tutorials on YouTube. For your comfort, we offer in this website tutorials and courses to learn to code.
Video games competencies:
The children will need to practice in their homes, playing Call of Duty, Need for Speed, League of Legends, and FIFA. April 14th, Friday, at 5 pm, will be the next videogames competence. The videogame that we will play will be Call of Duty. For video games, we have a lot of cheats and tips, to learn to use cheats and to learn how to recognize videogames patterns.

      <h3>Tutorials</h3>
      <p>
        Python short tutorial: 
If you like Python, first, you have to learn how to use Programming Building Blocks. You need to make your first program: Hello World. Also, you need to learn how to use comments. Comments are a way to say to the compiler that code we will not execute. Another thing is the Strings. Strings are a very important and interesting part of programming. Strings are used to make new programming languages, and Strings are used to format Integer values, Float values, and other entities. Also, there are predefined Strings like numbers, letters, and other ones. There are numeric data types, like Integers and Floats. With these data types, you can add, subtract, multiply, divide, calculate potencies, and other operations. There is a new data type: the Boolean type. When you create an if statement, you evaluate a Boolean type. For example, you can create a numeric variable and set it to a number, then, create an if statement and evaluate if the numeric variable is equal to a number. If the condition applies, the sentences inside the if statement, are executed. In this case, the evaluation returns a true value.
Call of Duty: 
Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game about the Second World War. You have to start the game as a soldier that is being trained in a camp. When that ends, you enter into a violent war against the Germans. You can be an English, a Russian, an American, and a Japanese.
You have weapons, guns, and grenades, and you have to kill the Germans at each level. Also, you can effect a recoil with your weapon, and you have a percentage of life.
Cheats: Invincibility: god, Full health – give health, Get all items – give all, Extra ammunition – give ammo, Ignored by enemy - notarget
