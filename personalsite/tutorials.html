            <p class="paragraph1">
                If you like Python, first, you have to learn how to use Programming Building Blocks. You need to make your first program: Hello World.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph2">
                Also, you need to learn how to use comments. Comments are a way to say to the program that code we will not execute.

                    Another thing is the Strings. Strings are a very big part of programming. Strings are used to make new coding languages, and Strings are used to format number values, Float values, and other objects.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph2">
                    Also, there are Strings like numbers, letters, and other ones. There are number data types, like Integers and Floats. With these data types, you can add, subtract, multiply, divide, perform powers, and other math functions.
                </p>

            <p>
                There is a new data type: the Boolean type. When you create an If block, you evaluate a Boolean type. For example, you can create a number variable and set it to a number, then, create an If block and check if the number variable is equal to a number. If the If returns True, the code inside the If block, are executed. In this case, the If returns a true value.
